    "# Report: Recipe Discovery - predicting popularity\n",
    "## Data Validation & Preprocessing\n",
    "Data preprocessing for model development included the following steps:  \n",
    "- **Recipe Column**: The recipe column is a unique identifier. This was confirmed by verifying that the recipe column has 947 unique values. To ensure that the unique identifier does not influence the model's predictions, the recipe column was dropped from the training data.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Verify that the 'recipe' column has 947 unique entries\n",
    "identifier = df['recipe'].nunique()\n",
    "print(f\"There's 947 rows in the dataset. The number of unique identifiers is {identifier}.\")\n",

    "# Drop the 'recipe' column as it is a unique identifier and not included in the model\n",
    "df = df.drop('recipe', axis=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Category Column**: The category column represents the type of cuisine and has no inherent order, classifying it as nominal data. Therefore, the category column was one-hot encoded to binary format using the pandas get_dummies() function.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# One-hot encode the 'category' column and remove the 'category_' prefix from column names\n",
    "df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['category'])\n",
    "df.columns = [col.replace('category_', '') for col in df.columns]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Servings Column**: The servings column has a natural order (1 < 2 < 4 < 6), making it ordinal data. To label encode the data, the servings column was stripped of trailing text and converted to integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Clean and convert the 'servings' column to integer, and capitalize the column name for plotting\n",
    "df['servings'] = df['servings'].str.replace(' as a snack', '').astype(int)\n",
    "df.rename(columns={'servings': 'Servings'}, inplace=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **High Traffic Column**: The high_traffic column was converted to binary format where 1 represents 'High' and 0 represents 'Low'.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Convert 'high_traffic' column to binary form: 1 if 'High', else 0\n",
    "df['high_traffic'] = df['high_traffic'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'High' else 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Dropping Inconsistent Columns**: Columns calories, carbohydrate, sugar, and protein were dropped from the training data due to:\n",
    "    - Missing values in over 5% of the rows.\n",
    "    - High variance (e.g. values for calories ranging between 0.1 and 3600).\n",
    "    - High number of outliers in each column.\n",
    "    - Logical inconsistencies (e.g. 185 rows where sugar content is greater than carbohydrate content).\n",

    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "The number of rows where sugar is greater than carbohydrate is 185.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Consequently, the reliability of this data was judged as low, and it was disregarded to avoid introducing bias and negatively affecting model accuracy and training efficiency.\n",
    "```python\n",

    "Figure 3 shows that recipes with higher serving sizes tend to have proportionally more \"High\" traffic postings. Specifically, the 4- and 6-servings categories show a significantly higher ratio of \"High\" to \"Low\" traffic recipes of 1.54 and 1.86 respectively. This is in comparison to 1- and 2-servings categories showing a ratio of 1.43 and 1.35 respectively. This trend suggests that recipes designed to serve more people are more popular and attract higher traffic on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Findings\n",
    "- **Serving Size Popularity**: Recipes designed for 4 servings are the most common, indicating a preference for recepies of medium-sized group meals.\n",

    "### Conclusion  \n",
    "The model evaluation process involved analyzing feature importance and assessing performance metrics for both Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Importance**: Both models identified Beverages, Vegetable, and Potato as key predictors for high traffic recipes. However, there is differences in the importance of features, especially Servings, which is ranked low by Logistic Regression but high by Random Forest.\n",
    "- **Overall Performance**: Both models perform similarly, with minor differences in their classification results. Logistic Regression has a slight edge in correctly identifying low traffic recipes (TN) and avoiding false negatives (FN), while Random Forest performs marginally better in reducing false positives (FP) and correctly identifying high traffic recipes (TP).\n",
    "- **Model Choice**: The choice between Logistic Regression and Random Forest can be guided by the specific priorities of the application. If minimizing false positives is crucial, Random Forest might be preferred. Conversely, if identifying true high traffic recipes is more important, Logistic Regression could be the better choice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, both models are effective for this classification task, and the differences in their confusion matrices are minimal, indicating comparable performance. The final decision on which model to use should consider the specific business objectives and the relative importance of precision versus recall. All evaluation metrics and visualizations indicate that both Logistic Regression and Random Forest models perform well on the dataset. Logistic Regression has a slight edge in precision and F1 Score, making it a better choice if minimizing false positives is crucial. On the other hand, Random Forest's higher recall suggests it is better at identifying true positives, which could be beneficial if capturing all high traffic recipes is more important. Overall, both models are effective in predicting high traffic recipes, with each model having its strengths in different metrics. The evaluation results provide a comprehensive understanding of the models' capabilities and highlight the importance of key features in driving predictions.  \n",

    "- **Revenue Impact**: Additional revenue generated from high traffic recipes. This metric quantifies the financial benefit of accurately predicting high traffic recipes.\n",
    "- **False Positive Rate**: Percentage of recipes predicted as high traffic that do not result in high traffic. This metric helps understand the cost of incorrect predictions in terms of wasted resources and potential user dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Performance & Business Metrics\n",
    "To evaluate the performance of the Logistic Regression and Random Forest models using the defined business metrics the following must be analyzed:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Conversion Rate**: The conversion rate, represented by precision, measures the percentage of recipes predicted to be high traffic that actually result in high traffic. A higher conversion rate indicates better model performance in accurately identifying high traffic recipes.\n",

    "**User Engagement**: Track average time spent on high traffic recipes to compare engagement levels. Higher user engagement can lead to increased user satisfaction, loyalty, and potentially higher ad revenue.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Revenue Impact**: Analyze additional revenue generated from high traffic recipes predicted by each model. By analyzing the additional revenue generated from high traffic recipes predicted by each model, we can quantify the financial benefit. This is achieved by comparing the revenue before and after implementing the models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**False Positive Rate**: The false positive rate helps assess the cost of incorrect predictions, indicating how often recipes predicted to be high traffic that do not actually result in high traffic. A lower false positive rate is desirable as it minimizes wasted resources and potential user dissatisfaction.\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression**: 15.7% (100% - 84.3%).  \n",
    "- **Random Forest**: 16.2% (100% - 83.8%).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Summary and Recommendations\n",
    "Both Logistic Regression and Random Forest models perform well in predicting high traffic recipes, with Logistic Regression having a slight edge in precision. This indicates that both models can effectively identify recipes that drive user engagement and generate additional revenue. Key business metrics such as conversion rate, user engagement, and revenue impact will measure whether using these models is beneficial to successfully meet business goals. However, the false positive rate underscores the need to balance precision and recall to minimize incorrect predictions and optimize resource allocation. Continuous monitoring of these metrics ensures alignment with organizational goals and supports data-driven decisions to improve user engagement and revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Selection**:\n",
    "- **Baseline Model**: Logistic Regression for its simplicity and interpretability.\n",
    "- **Comparison Model**: Random Forest to capture more complex relationships in the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Performance**:\n",
    "- **Overall Performance**: Both models perform similarly, with minor differences in their classification results. Logistic Regression has a slight edge in correctly identifying low traffic recipes (TN) and avoiding false negatives (FN), while Random Forest performs marginally better in reducing false positives (FP) and correctly identifying high traffic recipes (TP).\n",
    "- **Model Choice**: The choice between Logistic Regression and Random Forest can be guided by the specific priorities of the application. If minimizing false positives is crucial, Random Forest might be preferred. Conversely, if identifying true high traffic recipes is more important, Logistic Regression could be the better choice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, both models are effective for this classification task, and the differences in their confusion matrices are minimal, indicating comparable performance. The final decision on which model to use should consider the specific business objectives and the relative importance of precision versus recall.  \n",

    "**Key Insights from Feature Importances**:\n",
    "- **Beverages**: Most influential for predicting high traffic.\n",
    "- **Vegetables and Potatoes**: Significant contributors to high traffic.\n",
    "- **Servings**: Key feature in the Random Forest model, indicating its relevance in attracting high traffic. This is further suported by findings from Exploratory Data Analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "The feature importances from model results provide valuable insights for planning which recipes to publish. Below is suggestions on how to benefit from these insights:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus on High-Impact Categories**:\n",
    "- Beverages: Both models indicate that recipes in the Beverages category have the highest impact on predicting high traffic. Prioritize publishing more beverage recipes.  \n",
    "- Vegetables and Potatoes: Additionally these categories are highly important. Increase frequency of vegetarian recipes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimize Serving Sizes**:\n",
    "- The number of servings is a significant feature in the Random Forest model. Analyze and publish recipes with popular serving sizes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Diversify Recipe Categories**:\n",
    "- Ensure a balanced mix of moderately important categories like Breakfast, Pork, and Chicken to maintain variety and cater to different audience preferences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimize Low-Impact Categories**:\n",
    "- Only publish in categories like Desserts, Meat, Lunch/Snacks and One Dish Meals occasionally. While it's still beneficial to include these recipes, they should not be the primary focus.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasonal and Trend Analysis**:\n",
    "- **Seasonal Recipes**: Use the insights to plan seasonal recipes. For example, publish more vegetarian recipes during harvest seasons.  \n",
    "- **Trend Analysis**: Monitor trends and adjust your recipe publication strategy accordingly. If a particular category gains popularity, increase the frequency of related recipes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Marketing and Promotion**:\n",
    "- Highlight high-impact categories in marketing campaigns. Promote beverage and vegetarian recipes on social media and newsletters to attract more traffic.  \n",
    "- Use feedback and engagement metrics to refine strategy. If certain recipes receive more positive feedback, consider publishing similar recipes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Measure Business Metrics**:\n",
    "- **Traffic Increase**: Track the percentage increase in traffic after implementing model recommendations.  \n",
    "- **Engagement Rate**: Monitor the average engagement rate (likes, shares, comments) for published recipes.  \n",
    "- **Conversion Rate**: Measure the conversion rate of visitors to subscribers of premium content.  \n",
    "- **Recipe Popularity**: Track the average traffic per recipe category to identify the most popular categories.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on these recommendations, the business can leverage the predictive power of the models to drive more traffic, enhance user engagement, and ultimately increase revenue. Emphasizing beverages and vegetarian recipes, combined with content optimization and personalized recommendations, will help create a more engaging and user-friendly platform. This data-driven approach will optimize content strategy and achieve business objectives effectively."
